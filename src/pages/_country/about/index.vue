				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>Hello! My name is Akbar. "Us" in "about us" refers to me and my bad side, Bad Akbar, who tries really hard to spoil my plans. I made this site as a challenge for myself. While bad Akbar tried really hard to stop me like all the other times, I am glad to say I have succeeded in not falling for his schemes. I hope you enjoy using this site as I enjoyed in making it. If there is any problems or feedback, let us know through the Contact email.</p>
